# LiveTransparent Agent Notes

## Canonical Status

- Use [Project Status and Next Steps.md](./Project%20Status%20and%20Next%20Steps.md) for current priorities and live-state details.
- This file is the short operating guide: keep it current, but avoid duplicating long planning material here.

## Environment

- Deployed via Coolify on a VPS.
- Public hosts: `automations.livetransparent.com` for n8n and `reports.livetransparent.com` for the report host.
- Prefer Coolify internal service-to-service calls when possible.
- n8n target version: `2.19.5`.
- Canonical MCP: `n8n-lt`.
- Root `.env` is the reference copy; Coolify env vars are the deployed source of truth.

## Working Rules

- Check the live state before and after every mutation.
- Fetch first, patch second.
- Preserve n8n graph integrity: keep node IDs and connection maps aligned.
- Use `Switch` over `IF` for voice automations.
- Prefer raw JSON import for dialer patches.
- Use `={{ ... }}` expressions with `$('Node').item.json.field`.
- Prefer runbooks in `GHL Live Transparent CRM/` before changing GHL/n8n workflows.
- Use `Config` nodes only when env or credential access is blocked.

## Tooling

- Prefer `n8n-lt` MCP or direct API calls before browser workflows.
- GHL MCP: primary `ghl_official`, secondary `ghl_katwill_*`.
- Codex config: `C:\Users\edmon\.codex\config.toml`.

### Reporting Notes

- GA4 and GHL ingestion are live.
- GSC still needs workflow verification / cleanup.
- Meta Ads API access is validated against `act_2186975138800404`.
- Keep report validation end-to-end: ingest -> attribution bridge -> daily rollups -> executive summary.

## Other Live Systems

- SimpleTexting: Send, delivery, inbound reply, and unsubscribe webhooks are active.
- Unipile/LinkedIn: `LT - GHL LinkedIn Connect Dispatcher (Unipile)` is active, `LT - LinkedIn DM Sequence (Unipile)` is active, and `LT - LinkedIn Unipile New Messages` is active to stop sequences when people reply.
- GHL warm intake/routing, Apollo enrichment, and Emerald/Cold outreach are active.

## Outreach Notes

- LinkedIn invite copy is sourced from `outreach_messages.v2.docx`.
- LinkedIn DM copy is sourced from `outreach_messages.v2.docx`.
- LinkedIn DM timing is currently 0, 3, 4, 3, 4 days between sends after the first message clock starts.
- Active LinkedIn conversations are marked in `linkedin_connection_state` via `payload_json.dm_conversation_status = 'active'`.
- Future SMS campaign work should use `outreach_messages.docx` as the SMS source of truth, with shared Postgres state so send history and reply state are not duplicated across workflows.
- SMS campaign requirements:
  - tag each SMS send in Postgres so the same person is not messaged twice
  - separate send state from response state, but keep both in the same canonical table or a tightly controlled pair of tables
  - confirm inbound reply handling is active before sending volume
  - confirm opt-out handling and unsubscribe tagging are preserved
  - keep campaign batches controlled until the response workflow is verified
