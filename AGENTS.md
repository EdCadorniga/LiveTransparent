# LiveTransparent Agent Notes

## IMPORTANT — Read This First

Analyze the attached `repomix-output.md` file. It contains the core system architecture, code blueprints, and operational roadmaps for my LiveTransparent automation environment. Review my `AGENTS.md` and custom script setups (like `fix_intake_poller.js`) to understand how my infrastructure is organized. When I ask you to write code modifications, database queries, or new workflow nodes, ensure your suggestions strictly match this architecture and stay within my token budget.

**LLM context-loading order:**
1. `repomix-output.md` — start here for architecture, blueprints, and roadmaps
2. `AGENTS.md` (this file) — short operating guide
3. `Project Status and Next Steps.md` — current priorities and live-state
4. `Project Specifications.md` — system boundaries, guardrails, contracts
5. `plan.md` + sub-plans (`emerald-email-campaign/plan.md`, etc.) — active work plan
6. Custom scripts (`fix_intake_poller.js`, etc.) — infrastructure specifics
7. All other repo files — only when a task requires fine detail

## Canonical Status

- Use [Project Status and Next Steps.md](./Project%20Status%20and%20Next%20Steps.md) for current priorities and live-state details.
- This file is the short operating guide: keep it current, but avoid duplicating long planning material here.

## Environment

- Deployed via Coolify on a VPS.
- Public hosts: `automations.livetransparent.com` for n8n and `reports.livetransparent.com` for the report host.
- Prefer Coolify internal service-to-service calls when possible.
- n8n target version: `2.25.3` (upgraded from `2.19.5` on 2026-06-05 to fix cron scheduler issue).
- Canonical MCP: `n8n-lt`.
- Root `.env` is the reference copy; Coolify env vars are the deployed source of truth.

## Working Rules

- Check the live state before and after every mutation.
- Fetch first, patch second.
- Preserve n8n graph integrity: keep node IDs and connection maps aligned.
- Use `Switch` over `IF` for voice automations.
- Prefer raw JSON import for dialer patches.
- Use `={{ ... }}` expressions with `$('Node').item.json.field`.
- Prefer runbooks in `GHL Live Transparent CRM/` before changing GHL/n8n workflows.
- Use `Config` nodes only when env or credential access is blocked.

## Tooling

- Prefer `n8n-lt` MCP or direct API calls before browser workflows.
- GHL MCP: primary `ghl_official`, secondary `ghl_katwill_*`.
- Codex config: `C:\Users\edmon\.codex\config.toml`.
- **Avoid `n8n-lt` `updateNodeParameters` for Set v3.4 nodes.** It silently corrupts `assignments.assignments` from `[{...}]` to `{item: [{...}]}` and stringifies booleans (`"true"` instead of `true`) and `options: {}` to `""`. The MCP response reports warnings but the corruption persists AND auto-publishes. **Use direct n8n REST** (`PUT /api/v1/workflows/{id}` with `N8N_API_KEY_LT` from `.env` root) and verify with `GET /api/v1/workflows/{id}` checking both `nodes` (draft) and `activeVersion.nodes` (live). Known-good Config shape: `{"mode": "manual", "assignments": {"assignments": [{id, name, value}, ...]}}` — no `includeOtherFields` or `options` keys required.

## Live Voice System

| Item | Value |
|------|-------|
| Phone | `+1 (562) 534 1977` (`bd4ba248-a2b4-4738-b701-7c6a5ebb5bb4`) |
| Assistant | `3f9bbfd2-efa6-4381-81e6-26f2452d28f1` |
| Callback webhook | `https://automations.livetransparent.com/webhook/lt-voice-agent-vapi-callback` |
| Key env | `VAPI_PHONE_NUMBER_ID`, `GHL_LOCATION_ID=Zwz4relUXVPxx8uohnjV`, `GHL_API_KEY` / `GHL_PIT` |

### Voice Workflows

| Workflow | ID | Status |
|----------|----|--------|
| LT - Voice Agent V1 Vapi Callback + Tools | `fx4UvKUWbqJEY3LK` | Paused 2026-06-05 |
| LT - Voice Agent V1 Outbound Dialer (Vapi) | `r7UjWLndmc6EqEUW` | Paused 2026-06-05 |
| LT - Voice Queue Vapi Intake Poller | `bYk1Ai6MJLyhTsDZ` | Paused 2026-06-05 |
| LT - Voice Queue Enqueue | `XzcpOBi9YcIhJPck` | Paused 2026-06-05 |
| LT - Voice Dequeue Next | `KsBMFcz1YpBGrjDW` | Paused 2026-06-05 |
| LT - Call Outcome Ingest | `PUCfTZBANSPcgS0c` | Paused 2026-06-05 |
| LT - Apollo Queued Timeout Reaper | `RL5ZyUoshSPbmVA1` | Active (hourly) |

### Voice Tags

- `vapi_call_attempted`
- `vapi_dnc`
- `vapi_human_answered`
- `vapi_interested`
- `vapi_not_interested`
- `vapi_interest_unknown`
- `vapi_voicemail`
- `vapi_voicemail_left`
- `vapi_no_answer`
- `vapi_busy`
- `vapi_wrong_number`
- `vapi_contact_disconnected`

### Apollo Phone Enrichment Status (custom field `rgYJ7UqoznGoe3WeUAtH`)

- `enriched` — terminal (good)
- `no_match` — terminal (no Apollo hit)
- `error` — terminal (API error)
- `queued` — transient (intake sent request to Apollo, awaiting callback)
- `callback_timeout` — terminal (set by `LT - Apollo Queued Timeout Reaper` when `queued` is older than 24h or queued_at is missing). Backstop for the V4 callback URL not delivering; root cause still needs Apollo-side investigation.

### Custom field IDs (GHL)

- `Apollo Phone Enrichment Status` = `rgYJ7UqoznGoe3WeUAtH` (SINGLE_OPTIONS)
- `Apollo Phone Enrichment Queued At` = `NgC3xGTh0laQ9ArTnude` (DATE)
- `Enrich Phone via Apollo` = `gdJDuZelIxEBE6n9i5Q6` (SINGLE_OPTIONS: Yes/No)

### Reporting Notes

- GA4, GHL, and GSC ingestion are all live and active.
- GSC ingest and rollup bridge are active daily (verified from execution data).
- Report Pipeline Velocity (`iFfwh0jpYUZoDhDR`) is active.
- Meta Ads API access is validated against `act_2186975138800404` but spend ingest is still deferred.
- Keep report validation end-to-end: ingest -> attribution bridge -> daily rollups -> executive summary.

## Other Live Systems

- SimpleTexting: Send, delivery, inbound reply, and unsubscribe webhooks are active.
- Unipile/LinkedIn: All pipeline workflows are active and verified live.
- LinkedIn pipeline status (verified 2026-06-03): Sync seeds state table, Dispatcher sends connection requests, DM Sequence sends follow-ups with auto-connected-sync, daily limit enforcement, and reply detection.
- LinkedIn GHL token: `pit-b278b3ad-96bd-41fb-ba03-9f927039eb28` (from root `.env`). The alternate token `pit-2d2ed8c3-...` is broken (401), do not use.
- LinkedIn Code node regex pattern: always use `[/]` (character class) instead of `\/` in regex literals to avoid SDK JSON serialization corruption.
- GHL warm intake/routing, Apollo enrichment, and Emerald/Cold outreach are active.

## Outreach Notes

- LinkedIn invite copy is sourced from `outreach_messages.v2.docx`.
- LinkedIn DM copy is sourced from `outreach_messages.v2.docx`.
- LinkedIn DM timing is currently 0, 3, 4, 3, 4 days between sends after the first message clock starts.
- Active LinkedIn conversations are marked in `linkedin_connection_state` via `payload_json.dm_conversation_status = 'active'`.
- For LinkedIn supply, prefer seeding `linkedin_connection_state` from the working GHL contacts list and keep `linkedin_connected` rows out of the queue entirely.
- If you restart the session, re-check the live n8n executions for the sync, dispatcher, and DM workflows before saying the pipeline is healthy.
- SimpleTexting SMS campaign work is now staged in repo workflow exports, using `outreach_messages.docx` as the SMS source of truth.
- SMS campaign requirements:
  - tag each SMS send so the same person is not messaged twice
  - keep send state and response state in the same canonical table or a tightly controlled pair of tables
  - make sure inbound replies stop future sends and notify `#lead`
  - preserve opt-out handling and unsubscribe tagging
  - keep batches controlled until the pool filter and reply path are verified in live n8n

## repomix-output.md Refresh

After any significant work session (workflow fixes, new automations, config changes), regenerate `repomix-output.md` so next-session context is up to date:

1. `. $PROFILE`  
2. `packlive`

This stages key files into `C:\TempRepomixStaging`, runs `npx repomix --style markdown --compress --remove-comments --remove-empty-lines`, and copies the result back to the project root.
