# LiveTransparent Project Status and Next Steps

Updated: 2026-05-26

## Source Of Truth

This document is the canonical project status and next-steps reference.
It supersedes the duplicated planning notes in:

- [plan.md](./plan.md)
- [LiveTransparent Report Plan.md](./LiveTransparent%20Report%20Plan.md)

## Current State

- The outbound voice stack is live: queue-driven outbound calls, the merged callback webhook, and all 4 tools are active.
- The reporting stack is live: GA4 and GHL ingestion are in production, data is flowing into Postgres, and the Executive Report is live in GHL.
- Report rollups, attribution bridge, QA/alerts, and the executive summary API are already running.
- GSC still needs workflow verification / cleanup.
- Meta Ads API access is validated, but spend ingest is still deferred.

## Voice Workflows

### Live Voice System

- Phone: `+1 (562) 534 1977`
- Vapi Assistant ID: `3f9bbfd2-efa6-4381-81e6-26f2452d28f1`
- Canonical webhook: `https://automations.livetransparent.com/webhook/lt-voice-agent-vapi-callback`
- Target n8n version: `2.19.5`
- Canonical MCP: `n8n-lt`

### Active Workflows

- `LT - Voice Agent V1 Vapi Callback + Tools` (`fx4UvKUWbqJEY3LK`) — active, merged callback plus 4 tools
- `LT - Voice Agent V1 Outbound Dialer (Vapi)` (`r7UjWLndmc6EqEUW`) — active, queue dialer, contact-TZ-aware, 72h cooldown
- `LT - Voice Queue Vapi Intake Poller` (`bYk1Ai6MJLyhTsDZ`) — active, polls `vapi_queue`, E.164 bypass
- `LT - Voice Queue Enqueue` (`XzcpOBi9YcIhJPck`) — active, webhook enqueue, allows NULL phone
- `LT - Voice Dequeue Next` (`KsBMFcz1YpBGrjDW`) — active, webhook dequeue then Vapi call
- `LT - Call Outcome Ingest` (`PUCfTZBANSPcgS0c`) — active, GHL call webhooks to Postgres and Slack

### Dialer Pipeline

- Cron runs Monday through Friday, 9am to 5pm CT.
- The dialer fetches and locks queue rows, checks the contact, applies a timezone-safe calling window, and places the Vapi call.
- The pipeline then increments attempt counts, sets `next_attempt_at` to `NOW + 72h`, and writes the GHL note.
- The dialer prefers internal Coolify service-to-service communication where possible.

### Intake Pipeline

- Cron runs every 10 minutes.
- The intake poller searches GHL for `vapi_queue` contacts.
- Valid E.164 numbers are enqueued.
- Invalid or missing phone numbers are skipped when enrichment is not sufficient.

### Callback Tools

- `update_lead_status` updates the GHL tag and the Postgres disposition.
- `add_to_dnc` sets `voice_call_queue.dnc=true` and adds the GHL DNC tag.
- `log_call_outcome` upserts `voice_call_attempt` with disposition, notes, and follow-up time.
- `notify_sales` posts lead name and summary into `#leads`.

### Voice Tags

- `vapi_call_attempted`
- `vapi_dnc`
- `vapi_human_answered`
- `vapi_interested`
- `vapi_not_interested`
- `vapi_interest_unknown`
- `vapi_voicemail`
- `vapi_voicemail_left`
- `vapi_no_answer`
- `vapi_busy`
- `vapi_wrong_number`
- `vapi_contact_disconnected`

### Voice Hardening Remaining

- Move remaining secrets out of workflow `Config` nodes into credentials or env-backed config.
- Verify the dashboard still points all tools and the end-of-call webhook to the canonical callback URL.

## Next Steps

### 1. Voice Hardening

- Move remaining secrets out of workflow `Config` nodes into n8n credentials or env-backed config.
- Verify the Vapi dashboard still points all tools and the end-of-call webhook at the current callback URL.

### 2. Reporting Depth

- Expand the contact-capture panel by channel and landing page.
- Build matched funnel views by channel, campaign, and landing page.

### 3. Attribution Expansion

- Build Meta Ads ingest for spend, clicks, impressions, and cost metrics.
- Keep the user-facing emphasis on attribution first, then cost reporting.

### 4. Cleanup And Adjacent Automation

- Finish SimpleTexting secret hardening.
- Build the GHL-to-LinkedIn automation.
- Retry and enable the blocked GSC ingest workflow.

## Reporting Workflows

### Workflow List

- `LT - Report Config Sync` (`aomO3Z4AXJIgEvvN`) — active, seeds report settings and runtime flags
- `LT - GHL Daily Leads Ingest` (`osIJOgBmWITF5Yuv`) — active, rebuilt replacement for archived `OtqWjqGXZC3OcrXP`
- `LT - GHL Daily Sales Ingest` (`aYT5oHcgmBALzHy5`) — active
- `LT - Report Attribution Bridge` (`Y0TU7Il71JswxOBp`) — active
- `LT - Report Daily Rollups` (`EUeOiRttoVLQ9zF9`) — active
- `LT - Report Executive Summary API` (`Bukc0mgOD2r7V6ED`) — active
- `LT - Report QA and Alerts` (`M5mXcDTFSko6EdHb`) — active
- `LT - Report Publish Refresh` (`3gXztCnBEN6sGINb`) — active
- `LT - Report Postgres Bootstrap Apply` (`3XHThUiUSNa4sTb9`) — active

### Live Reporting State

- GA4 ingestion is live and feeding the executive report.
- GHL leads and sales ingestion is live and flowing into Postgres.
- The report host is live and secure.
- The GHL `Executive Report` custom menu entry points at the report host.
- The executive summary webhook is live and returns GHL-first report JSON from Postgres.
- `LT - Report Daily Rollups` preserves GA-backed channel, UTM, landing-page, and daily traffic rows.
- Funnel-efficiency metrics are live in the executive summary API and embedded report.

### Current Cohort Notes

- `contactToOpportunityRate` uses a contact-safe cohort metric instead of a raw multi-opportunity total.
- The current 30-day new-contact cohort is still returning `0` matched contact-to-opportunity progression.
- The current attribution coverage result for that same cohort is `97` contacts, `45` with usable source fields, `45` attributed bridge matches, and `22` lead-to-sale matches after normalized raw contact IDs and stored-field fallbacks.

### Report Model

- Raw tables cover GA4 sessions, GA4 pages, GA4 events, GSC queries, GSC pages, GSC site, GHL contacts, GHL opportunities, GHL pipeline history, and GHL forms.
- Bridge tables cover traffic-to-lead, lead-to-sale, and identity mapping.
- Rollup tables cover daily summary, channel summary, funnel summary, pipeline summary, stage summary, UTM summary, and landing page summary.

### Report Next Work

1. Expand the contact-capture panel by channel and landing page.
2. Build matched funnel views by channel, campaign, and landing page.
3. Build Meta Ads ingest for spend, clicks, impressions, and cost metrics.
4. Finish SimpleTexting secret hardening.
5. Build GHL-to-LinkedIn automation.
6. Retry and enable the blocked GSC ingest workflow.

### Report Dependencies

- GA4 property ID is still the external dependency for any remaining GA4 API wiring work.
- Meta Ads API access is validated on `2026-05-05` against `act_2186975138800404`.
- For GA4 service account wiring, use a secret-backed JSON file in Coolify and keep the credentials out of source control.

## Operating Notes

- Prefer Coolify internal service-to-service communication where possible.
- Verify live state after every mutation: fetch first, patch second, audit live workflow plus recent execution before declaring a fix.
- Preserve graph integrity when editing n8n workflows: keep existing node IDs and keep the connections map aligned.
- For voice automations, prefer `Switch` over `IF`, and use raw JSON import for dialer patches.
- Report end-to-end validation should still span leads ingest, attribution bridge, daily rollups, and executive summary output.

## Working Order

1. Voice hardening.
2. Reporting depth.
3. Meta attribution.
4. Cleanup and adjacent automation.
