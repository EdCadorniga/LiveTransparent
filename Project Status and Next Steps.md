# LiveTransparent Project Status and Next Steps

Updated: 2026-07-24 (n8n 2.31.5 upgrade, Vapi hardening, SimpleTexting send fix)

## Source Of Truth

This document is the canonical project status and next-steps reference. It supersedes duplicated planning notes in plan.md and other plan documents.

> **Historical traceability**: Fix narratives, root-cause analyses, and execution histories are preserved in git history. This file contains only current live state and actionable next steps.

## Current State Summary

- **Voice stack**: ACTIVE since 2026-07-14, hardened 2026-07-16, optimized 2026-07-20, and call-path hardened 2026-07-23. All 3 outbound assistants (Jordan/Dispensary, Alex/Brand, Savannah/V1) updated: compliance disclosure removed from voicemail, discovery questions restructured to one-at-a-time with turn-taking enforcement, IVR/voicemail disambiguation added, stage-direction/throat-clearing ban, pronunciation fixes, `{{contact_name}}`→`{{first_name}}` variable corrected. The dialer uses n8n's native Schedule Trigger every 2 minutes plus a timezone-aware business-hours guard; no external cron job is used. The callback webhook no longer automatically invokes the dequeue helper, and `LT - Voice Dequeue Next` is unpublished so it cannot start unscheduled calls. Callback metadata extraction, GHL note JSON handling, queue completion parameters, tag failure handling, and the 8-tag plus DNC suppression blocklist were hardened. The dialer now marks selected rows `in_progress` before the Vapi request, preventing ambiguous request failures from retrying the same contact; no-phone and outside-hours branches restore `pending`. Poller searches 4 tag pools with rotation, 30/cycle, and removes the source campaign tag after enqueueing. Post-upgrade verification still shows no new dialer executions after republishing, so scheduler health remains an open operational issue.
- **n8n runtime**: upgraded to target `2.31.5`. Native Schedule Trigger is the standard for recurring workflows. The Python task-runner warning during deployment is expected for JavaScript-only workflows; the transient database ping timeout recovered during startup. A callback timer gate fix was published after finding that skipped warning/end actions could still reach their Vapi HTTP nodes. A subsequent dialer execution remains queued as `new` with no start time, so scheduler/worker health remains an open operational issue.
- **Emerald email campaign**: ACTIVE since 2026-07-07. Dispatches ~14,702 unenrolled contacts through GHL email sequences.
- **DAN email campaign**: FULLY LIVE AND SENDING since 2026-07-14. 10 templates, 3 GHL workflows, n8n dispatcher active (65/run every 30 min, 1,560/day capacity). ghl_contact_id backfilled 2026-07-13 (13,705 IDs). 181+ contacts queued first day with verified email delivery.
- **Apollo phone enrichment**: ACTIVE and hardened 2026-07-16. Production path is polling + V4 callback + reaper. Legacy staged webhook orphans were canceled, poller now re-discovers `queued_phone`, callback provider failures map to `callback_failed`, and known blank contacts were backfilled into `queued_phone`.
- **LinkedIn**: Production path is dispatcher -> acceptance/state sync -> canonical 4-message DM sequence. Follower DM and misconfigured Instagram DM sender paths are unpublished. Guardrails include fail-closed reply checks, inbound/reply state sync, terminal DM completion tagging, and GHL `stop_linkedin_dms` suppression.
- **Instagram**: old DM Sequence is unpublished after it was found using the LinkedIn Unipile account. New inbound bridge is active and posts messages into GHL Conversations under `Instagram via Unipile`.
- **Social provider bridge**: Instagram and LinkedIn inbound both work through SMS-type custom conversation providers (`LinkedIn: 6a58a14ff3023bea3783c152`, `Instagram: 6a58a1193cdfc36997580a68`). Inbound uses `type: "Custom"`, not `SMS`, and avoids dummy phone/email data. GHL duplicate cleanup consolidated Edmundo Cadorniga to canonical contact `XZ4yChllGBdcsVxhFRDe`; both Instagram chat `yx-R-9J6XdWaFpGOQd1JFA` and LinkedIn chat `60Ult1SrWhOuvuZp1u7nXw` now map there. GHL Conversations is the operator-facing inbox; no dedicated macro dashboard or alert digest is live yet. Detailed handoff and operator runbook live in `docs/strategy/unipile-ghl-bidirectional-integration.md`.
- **Reporting**: GA4, GHL, GSC ingestion live. Executive report live in GHL.
- **SMS campaign**: SimpleTexting dispatcher is live as of 2026-07-18. On 2026-07-24, the send boundary was fixed and published: campaign messages now use SimpleTexting `AUTO` mode instead of hardcoded `SINGLE_SMS_STRICTLY`, failed provider claims are retryable, and GHL conversation mirroring requires a real provider message ID. A safe simulation passed; the next scheduled live run must confirm provider delivery.
- **John->Jason migration**: Complete on n8n side. GHL workflows updated. Template keys preserved.

### Fixes Applied — Original (2026-07-14)

- **Published** both Intake Poller and Outbound Dialer (were paused for quality gate)
- **Trigger Apollo Enrichment auth**: changed `predefinedCredentialType` → `none` (was crashing because GHL API key is already in headers)
- **Remove Tag - Enriching URL**: changed `$json.contact_id` → `$json.contact.id` (Apollo response nests ID under `contact`)
- **Full pagination**: GHL contact search was limited to first 20 contacts per tag. Added pagination loop with 250ms delays.
- **30-contact batch cap**: prevents GHL rate limiting on downstream API calls
- **Pool tag search**: added `brands_pool` (3,024) and `dispensaries_pool` (7,953) to search tags alongside `vapi_campaign_brand` (926) and `vapi_campaign_dispensary` (19)
- **Tag rotation**: cycles through one tag per 10-min run to ensure all pools are scanned evenly
- **Timezone inference**: added state-to-timezone mapping in both intake poller (`Classify Contacts`) and outbound dialer (`Code - Check Phone`). Maps US state/Canadian province codes to IANA timezone names (e.g. `NY`→`America/New_York`). Most pool contacts lack timezone data, so this ensures ET contacts get called at 9am ET.
- **Historical ET-forward timing**: the previous cron-based schedule shifted from `*/2 14-22` to `*/2 13-22` UTC to start calling at 9am ET instead of 10am ET. The current implementation uses a native two-minute Schedule Trigger; the timezone-aware business-hours guard remains authoritative.

### Fixes Applied — Round 2 (2026-07-14, Full Vapi Audit)

A comprehensive logic/code/optimization audit of all 12 Vapi workflows found 5 bugs across 3 active workflows, all fixed and published:

**1. Race condition: Dialer could send duplicate calls** (r7UjWLndmc6EqEUW)
`Postgres - Fetch Next Queue Item` was a read-only `SELECT...LIMIT 1`. Between the read and the write, `LT - Voice Dequeue Next` could `UPDATE...RETURNING` the same item. Fixed: changed to `UPDATE...FROM...RETURNING` that atomically locks the row at fetch time.

**2. `report_referral` tool was dead code** (fx4UvKUWbqJEY3LK)
Routed to end-of-call handler that checked `endedReason`/`analysis.summary` — absent on tool call payloads. Node returned `[]` silently. Fixed: re-routed to `Respond - 200`.

**3. Intake Poller could create duplicate queue entries** (bYk1Ai6MJLyhTsDZ)
INSERT lacked `WHERE NOT EXISTS` dedup check. Fixed: wrapped INSERT with `WHERE NOT EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM voice_call_queue WHERE contact_id = $1 AND status IN ('pending', 'in_progress'))`. Also fixed `Transform Postgres Output` to return `[]` gracefully when dedup blocks insertion (was throwing).

**4. Workflow-crashing tag removals** (bYk1Ai6MJLyhTsDZ)
Three HTTP DELETE nodes lacked `continueOnFail`. A flaky GHL API call crashed the workflow after enqueue/enrich/skip already succeeded. Fixed: enabled `continueOnFail: true` on all three.

**5. Timer race condition** (fx4UvKUWbqJEY3LK)
`$getWorkflowStaticData('global')` not atomic across concurrent executions. Two rapid status-update webhooks could both start a 465-second timer chain. Fixed: replaced `timersScheduled` boolean with `timersScheduledAt` timestamp and 60-second dedup window.

### Fixes Applied — Call-Path and Callback Hardening (2026-07-22 to 2026-07-23)

- **Unscheduled call path removed**: the callback workflow previously posted to `LT - Voice Dequeue Next` after every end-of-call event. That helper could start another Vapi call without the dialer's Schedule Trigger. The callback trigger was removed and `LT - Voice Dequeue Next` was unpublished; it is now an explicit helper only.
- **Callback payload recovery**: the callback Config Set node replaced the webhook input before detection. `Code - Detect Tool vs Callback` now reads the original `Webhook - Vapi` item directly.
- **End-of-call metadata coverage**: the normalizer now reads IDs from Vapi `assistant.metadata`, `assistant.variableValues`, and `artifact.variables` paths.
- **GHL note safety**: completion-note JSON now uses an object expression instead of interpolating unescaped summaries into a JSON string. Note and tag writes are non-blocking so a CRM note failure cannot prevent queue completion.
- **Queue completion safety**: `Postgres - Mark Queue Completed` now passes query replacements as an array, preventing the scalar-parameter error that previously stopped completion.
- **Scheduler standardization**: the outbound dialer uses a fresh native Schedule Trigger with a two-minute interval. The business-hours guard remains the call eligibility authority. The workflow is active and published, but post-upgrade execution history showed no new dialer runs even after an explicit unpublish/publish cycle; investigate scheduler registration before resuming production dialing.

### Queue State

~28 contacts initially enqueued from enriched vapi_campaign_brand/dispensary pools. New pool contacts fed in at 30/cycle via tag rotation. SQL `WHERE NOT EXISTS` prevents duplicate enqueue. Outbound dialer is configured for a native two-minute Schedule Trigger and picks up from queue only during timezone-aware business hours; the scheduler currently requires post-upgrade investigation.

### Final Production Hardening — 2026-07-23

- Callback timer state now has the existing 60-second duplicate-start guard plus 30-minute pruning of ended/inactive records.
- `LT - Voice Queue Enqueue` now requires `X-LT-Voice-Queue-Secret`; callers use `VOICE_QUEUE_ENQUEUE_SECRET` and unauthenticated requests fail closed before queue insertion.
- Apollo phone-request failures are counted as `apollo_phone_request_failed` for monitoring.
- `LT - Apollo Queued Timeout Reaper` now connects its Slack summary builder to `Post to Slack #leads`.
- Removed the stale response-code option from `LT - Call Outcome Ingest`.
- All modified live workflow versions were verified published with matching `versionId` and `activeVersionId`.

### LinkedIn Queue State

Legacy step-4 LinkedIn DM rows are now marked with `linkedin_dm_sequence_completed` and excluded from future DM selection. The GHL connect dispatcher was stuck with 0 `ready` contacts because its feeder tag check was broken (never detected blocking tags). Fixed 2026-07-14 by unwrapping GHL's nested `contact.tags` response. 14,987 contacts from CSV bulk-upserted as `connection_status = 'ready'` on 2026-07-13. Dispatcher should now find contacts on its next scheduled run.

### Call History Summary (voice_call_attempt)

1,711 total attempts across 1,045 unique contacts. Dispositions: voicemail=782, qualified/booked=305, connected=288, no_answer=212, busy=106, failed=18.

## LinkedIn Workflows (Production Active + Duplicate Send Paths Stopped)

| Workflow | ID | Schedule | Notes |
|----------|----|----------|-------|
| LT - LinkedIn DM Sequence (Unipile) | d0tEtijajisIsYcs | 0 12-22 * * 1-5 | Fixed trailing backtick in jsCode; added template pre-sanitize + send-time sanitize in both DM sender nodes |
| LT - LinkedIn Follower DM Sequence (Unipile) | pq7XVajNFnnwMUTr | Unpublished | Redundant one-touch follower DM path; stopped 2026-07-16 after canonical connected-contact DM sequence was confirmed as the only production DM path |
| LT - GHL LinkedIn Connect Dispatcher (Unipile) | fXxw5lanZcDmUrst | */15 15-21 * * 1-5 | Fixed GHL response unwrap in tag check; added send-time sanitize for invites; added linkedin_dm_sequence_completed to Feeder tag block |
| LT - LinkedIn Connection State Sync (Unipile) | ceaKnz6E3onQrZpt | 15 */6 * * * | Reduced maxPages 15→5, maxContacts 200→50 |
| LT - LinkedIn Connection Acceptance Checker (Unipile) | 3ttEvr5NMcQCS4Hp | Webhook | Replaced $env.UNIPILE_ACCOUNT_ID with hardcoded value |
| LT - LinkedIn Connection State Upsert (Unipile) | Old7ZvyVYgFaJgDr | Webhook | No changes |
| LT - LinkedIn Unipile New Messages (Unipile) | 7o5EBdvwAuIaWW7k | Webhook | No changes |
| LT - LinkedIn DM Sequence Test (No Delay) | wnpVYUNFLyNe5cS6 | Manual only | No changes |
| **LT - LinkedIn DM Suppression from GHL Tag** | **IPN8jnR3XSurX0o1** | **Webhook** | **NEW 2026-07-15. GHL tag stop_linkedin_dms → webhook → Unipile lookup → GHL tag + state table terminal** |

Intentionally stopped non-canonical sender: `LT - Instagram DM Sequence (Unipile)` (`iCnY6ccdHhfJg3sf`) is unpublished. It was using the LinkedIn Unipile account ID and sending Instagram templates as LinkedIn DMs via `instagram_dm_state`.

Guardrails: John-branded copy blocked before Unipile send. Invite defaults say Transparent eCom (not LiveTransparent).

Outbound guardrails: DM sends now fail closed if the reply lookup fails, and both DM / request paths skip when an inbound conversation is already present.

### 2026-07-15 Unicode Encoding Fix
All audited Unipile message sender nodes now sanitize message text before API calls, and template registries are pre-sanitized where present. Coverage includes LinkedIn DM Sequence (`Sync Connected from Unipile` and `Send DM Sequence Messages`), LinkedIn Follower DM, LinkedIn Dispatcher invites, and Instagram DM Sequence. `sanitizeMessage()` handles smart punctuation plus mojibake forms like `canâ€™t` / `canΓÇÖt`. Final live audit passed: active versions published, send-time sanitization present, registry pre-sanitization present where applicable, and no remaining bad literal template text in audited sender nodes. Created `scripts/suppress_linkedin_dms.py` for one-command DM suppression.

### 2026-07-16 Sender Path Cleanup
Malformed LinkedIn screenshot messages were traced to `LT - Instagram DM Sequence (Unipile)`, not the canonical LinkedIn DM Sequence. Unpublished both `iCnY6ccdHhfJg3sf` and redundant `pq7XVajNFnnwMUTr`; production LinkedIn outreach is now dispatcher → acceptance/state sync → canonical 4-message DM sequence only.

### 2026-07-14 Fixes Summary
- **Connection Acceptance Checker**: `$env.UNIPILE_ACCOUNT_ID` blocked by N8N_BLOCK_ENV_ACCESS_IN_NODE → hardcoded
- **Connection State Sync**: Code node timed out at 300s → reduced batch sizes
- **Follower DM Sequence**: Code referenced missing Config fields → added them
- **DM Sequence**: Trailing backtick in `jsCode` caused syntax error → removed
- **Dispatcher feeder tag check**: `GET /contacts/{id}` returns tags at `contact.tags`, not flat `tags`. Whole pipeline was stuck because blocking tags were never detected. Fixed by unwrapping through `.contact` first.

### Dispatcher Queue State
The `linkedin_connection_state` table was exhausted (all contacts at `requested`/`connected` from June). User exported 14,987 contacts from GHL with LinkedIn URLs and no blocking tags. Batch-upserted via state upsert webhook as `connection_status = 'ready'`. Dispatcher's Fetch Ready Queue should now find contacts on next run.

## Instagram

### Active

| Workflow | ID | Status | Notes |
|----------|----|--------|-------|
| LT - Instagram Unipile New Messages | pISlgYUsyJIrLuJd | Active webhook | Receives Unipile Instagram inbound payloads at `/webhook/lt-unipile-instagram-new-messages`, normalizes identity, creates/updates GHL contacts, persists `instagram_conversation_map`, converts the stored agency OAuth token to a location token, and posts inbound messages into GHL Conversations under `Instagram via Unipile`. |

### Stopped

| Workflow | ID | Status | Why |
|----------|----|--------|-----|
| LT - Instagram DM Sequence (Unipile) | iCnY6ccdHhfJg3sf | Unpublished | It was using LinkedIn Unipile account `V9eiHiDpRmCtan0YNdzsQw` and could send Instagram templates as LinkedIn DMs through `instagram_dm_state`. Do not republish until rebuilt with Instagram account `F2UprZ8aQc6Qm9CYYWU6cg`, account-type guard, reply suppression, and safe cadence. |

### 2026-07-16 Inbound Mapping Status

- Detailed build context, endpoint contracts, known test payload, and next steps: [docs/strategy/unipile-ghl-bidirectional-integration.md](./docs/strategy/unipile-ghl-bidirectional-integration.md)
- Confirmed real Instagram Unipile account: `F2UprZ8aQc6Qm9CYYWU6cg` (`Transparent eCom`).
- Confirmed test inbound identity: `edmundocadorniga`, profile provider ID `6361495593`, messaging/provider ID `109928757071246`, chat ID `yx-R-9J6XdWaFpGOQd1JFA`.
- Created GHL custom fields for Instagram username/profile URL/profile provider ID/chat attendee ID/chat ID.
- Post-merge cleanup: GHL duplicate contacts for `Edmundo Cadorniga` were consolidated to canonical contact `XZ4yChllGBdcsVxhFRDe`; `instagram_conversation_map.id = 1` now maps chat `yx-R-9J6XdWaFpGOQd1JFA` to that canonical contact.
- Inbound OAuth fix: the workflow converts the stored agency token to a location token inline before calling GHL inbound APIs.
- Direct outbound router test: POST to `/webhook/lt-social-provider-outbound` routed the known Instagram contact/chat to Unipile successfully with message id `DOfjxs8_Xm26V5Ee1IO7PQ`.
- Map repair verification: temporary maintenance workflow `nuuB3qCKxr7J6iPw` repointed Instagram map row `1` and LinkedIn map row `2` to `XZ4yChllGBdcsVxhFRDe`, then was archived. Direct outbound router checks succeeded for Instagram (`vjdEYSk9XD6R0I46oPWLwA`) and LinkedIn (`C7I9944kWsSKutX2XhZEpA`).
- GHL UI outbound verification: message `this is a test reply from GHL to Instagram` routed through `LT - Social Provider Outbound Router` to Unipile message `iEJO1vnvWVGwbk7ril1__A`.

### Social Provider Next Steps

- Monitor the next real Instagram inbound after duplicate cleanup; avoid artificial replays unless needed because they create visible conversation messages.
- Confirm Unipile Instagram webhook delivery to `/webhook/lt-unipile-instagram-new-messages` in production.
- `LT - Social Provider Outbound Router` (`kqIi8i1RjFAZKrK3`) direct webhook path is fixed and routes canonical contact `XZ4yChllGBdcsVxhFRDe` to Instagram and LinkedIn via Unipile successfully using canonical provider IDs.
- Optionally run a controlled LinkedIn GHL UI outbound reply test from conversation `Ze8o3KbsrwuAXQ3KK5ge`.
- Build and verify a lightweight macro alert/digest path for inbound LinkedIn/Instagram messages after they are successfully posted to GHL Conversations.
- Rebuild Instagram outbound/follower DM only after the bidirectional inbox path is stable and guarded.

## Apollo Phone Enrichment (Repaired 2026-07-14, Audited + Hardened 2026-07-15)

### Before Fix (2026-07-14)

All 3 webhook-based workflows had 0 executions since 2026-05-13. 1,279 contacts collected `callback_timeout`. Entire pipeline was dead.

### After Fix (2026-07-14)

New **LT - Apollo Phone Enrichment Polling** (JH8ShfpglWmLMZ3l) replaces the webhook-based intake:

1. **Sync profile match**: Calls Apollo `/v1/people/match`, writes name/email/company/LinkedIn/title/dept/revenue to GHL immediately
2. **Async phone request**: Calls Apollo with `webhook_url` pointing to existing V4 callback handler
3. **V4 callback** receives phone data and updates GHL

State as of activation (first hour): 60 contacts enriched, 30/run at 30-min cadence.

### 2026-07-15 Full Audit (7 workflows)

Full review found 2 CRITICAL bugs (`queued_phone` invisible to reaper, Intake Poller re-trigger), 2 HIGH issues (HTTP wrapper, V3 no error handling), and several medium/low cleanups. **10 fixes applied across 6 workflows**:

| # | Severity | Fix |
|---|----------|-----|
| 1 | CRITICAL | Reaper now monitors both `queued` + `queued_phone`; polling writes `Queued At` date |
| 2 | CRITICAL | Intake Poller routes `queued_phone` to `waiting` (was defaulting to `enrich`) |
| 3 | CRITICAL | Sheet First SQL injection fixed — parameterized query replacing template literal |
| 4 | HIGH | `doHttpRequest` wrapper removed from all 4 active workflows (V4, V3, Intake Poller, Sheet First) |
| 5 | HIGH | V3 callback: added error handling catch block with `callback_failed`, then **unpublished** V3 |
| 6 | MEDIUM | Polling `ghl()` now returns status codes; 429 triggers 5s retry on all 3 search sources |
| 7 | MEDIUM | V4 `Apollo Contact Id` now always set (was phone-gated) |
| 8 | LOW | Reaper Config node corruption cleaned (nested `parameters.parameters` removed) |
| 9 | LOW | Intake Poller `removeTag()` — removed `$httpRequest` fallback, now direct `this.helpers.httpRequest` |
| 10 | N/A | `$httpRequest` reference eliminated from all Apollo workflows |

### Pipeline Status (end-to-end)

| Step | Workflow | Handles |
|------|----------|---------|
| Discovery | Intake Poller (bYk1) | Tags contacts, sets `Enrich Phone via Apollo = Yes` |
| Sync match | Polling (JH8Sh) | Apollo `/v1/people/match` → writes profile, sets `queued_phone` + date |
| Async phone | Polling (JH8Sh) | Apollo with webhook → V4 callback |
| Phone callback | V4 Callback (U7c6) | Writes phone to GHL + `enriched` status |
| Re-enqueue | Intake Poller (bYk1) | Finds `enriched` contacts → inserts to voice_call_queue |
| Timeout | Reaper (RL5Zy) | Hourly scan for `queued` + `queued_phone` → `callback_timeout` after 24h |

### Workflow Summary

| Workflow | ID | Status | Purpose |

### 2026-07-16 Production Hardening

- Verified live production workflows are active and published:
  - Polling `JH8ShfpglWmLMZ3l`
  - Callback V4 `U7c6byTLXAMgcS75`
  - Reaper `RL5ZyUoshSPbmVA1`
- Canceled **1,008** orphaned `running` executions on legacy staged workflow `WuxgTa0EEL1mb2SA`. Sample stuck runs never progressed past the `Webhook` node.
- Polling workflow fix: orphan status rediscovery now includes both `queued` and `queued_phone`.
- Callback V4 fix: Apollo provider-level callback failures now map to `callback_failed` rather than silently landing as `no_match`.
- Polling write-path fix: hardened GHL `PUT /contacts/{id}` fallback after reproducing live API behavior.
  Working update shape is `customFields` without `locationId`; payloads containing `locationId` or `customField` can return `422`.
- Polling now has a minimal fallback write so contacts are not left blank when the full Apollo profile write fails.
- Backfilled 6 previously blank contacts into `queued_phone` on 2026-07-16:
  `VXwNjbZyBm1DMNljim6g`, `K9otZl89OAFlWmGk8fY7`, `mUgGwrkOB8CW8reYmpMd`, `e7eu0xGixu3ATmA61OqN`, `KA8xGJbf0QZHxXV6HXWF`, `8uobjmgriFLAdtmHfjk7`.

## SMS Campaign — SimpleTexting via GHL (LIVE 2026-07-20)

GHL App: `LiveTransparent SimpleTexting SMS`, provider `SimpleTexting SMS` (`6a5b91913953360948dd59f1`), SMS-type, Custom Conversation Provider, Delivery URL: `https://automations.livetransparent.com/webhook/lt-simpletexting-provider-outbound`.

### Live n8n Workflow State

| Workflow | ID | Status | Role |
|----------|----|--------|------|
| LT - SimpleTexting Provider Outbound Router | f4VoO1lBWkYRcQai | Active | Receives GHL outbound messages at `/webhook/lt-simpletexting-provider-outbound`, validates provider ID, normalizes phone to E.164, sends via idempotent boundary → SimpleTexting API. Skips business-hours guard for human replies. |
| LT - SimpleTexting Inbound Reply (Webhook) | i0pROHpFtN4LYR0Q | Active | Slack alert preserved. Now also posts inbound messages to GHL Conversations under `SimpleTexting SMS` via `type: "Custom"` + `conversationProviderId`. |
| LT - SimpleTexting SMS Send (Webhook, Staged) | Q3Ivnwe4z2Y3cD7A | Active | Mirrors successful outbound campaign sends into GHL Conversations under `SimpleTexting SMS`. |
| LT - SMS Idempotent Send | gwaEpWDpTIwsafi8 | Active | Canonical deduplicated SMS boundary. Called by outbound router and campaign send paths. |
| LT - SimpleTexting Pool Dispatcher (Staged) | usxYXSuc4ahw40V3 | Active | `sms_drip`, 10/run, weekdays 10:15am + 3:00pm ET, `defaultDryRun=false`. |
| LT - SimpleTexting Campaign Sequencer (Staged) | 7mSiivR3NhtLIcNz | Active | 6-step flow, 2-day inter-step delay. |
| LT - SimpleTexting Delivery Events (Webhook) | AEi1VCzkLvaYFr4U | Active | No changes needed. |
| LT - SimpleTexting Unsubscribe Events (Webhook) | IyBKMkpYQ7pa0C8V | Active | No changes needed. |

### DB Table

`simpletexting_conversation_map` — UNIQUE on `(conversation_provider_id, alt_id)`, with indexes on `ghl_contact_id` and `normalized_phone`. Created on first outbound router execution.

### Phone Format Contract

- Canonical phone: E.164, e.g. `+17144696406`.
- Conversation `altId`: `simpletexting:+17144696406`.
- `simpletexting_conversation_map.normalized_phone`: E.164 only.
- Outbound router has full E.164 normalization (`normalizePhoneE164`). AltId for inbound/outbound mirroring uses `simpletexting:+1<10-digit>` which works for US numbers. Full E.164 migration across delivery/unsubscribe workflows is deferred.
- `simpletext_replied` blocks automated sends; `simpletext_stop` blocks all sends including human GHL provider replies.

### Guardrails

- Human replies bypass business-hours limits but still enforce STOP suppression.
- Outbound router validates `conversationProviderId` against `6a5b91913953360948dd59f1`.
- Idempotent send deduplicates on `(contact_id, workflow_id, message_hash)` per day.
- `simpletext_stop` tag check in outbound router blocks provider-originated sends to opted-out contacts.
- SMS Send mirroring runs on `onError: continueRegularOutput` so mirror failures don't block sends.
- SimpleTexting send boundary uses `AUTO` mode so multi-segment campaign messages are accepted; provider errors are persisted for diagnosis and can be reclaimed on retry.
- Campaign mirroring is gated on `action = message_sent` and a non-empty provider message ID. Dry runs, blocked sends, duplicates, and provider errors do not call GHL Conversations.
- Inbound reply still posts to Slack AND GHL Conversations; Slack alert preserved as secondary channel.

### 2026-07-24 Fix And Next-Run Check

- Root cause of the `409` provider errors: `LT - SMS Idempotent Send` hardcoded `SINGLE_SMS_STRICTLY`, while SMS 1 is 320 characters and requires multi-segment delivery.
- Root cause of the GHL `404 Contact id not given`: `LT - SimpleTexting SMS Send` mirrored blocked and dry-run outcomes instead of only successful provider sends.
- Fixed and published workflows: `LT - SMS Idempotent Send` (`gwaEpWDpTIwsafi8`) and `LT - SimpleTexting SMS Send (Webhook, Staged)` (`Q3Ivnwe4z2Y3cD7A`).
- Safe checks passed: idempotent `simulate:true` execution `241272`; campaign dry run `241275` stopped before the mirror node.
- **Next scheduled dispatcher check:** confirm at least one `status = sent` result with a real SimpleTexting provider message ID, no HTTP `409`, no GHL `Contact id not given` errors, and a matching `report_sms_sent.provider_response` record. Then confirm the campaign state advances to `sent_step_1` only for an actual provider send.

### State

GA4, GHL, and GSC ingestion are all live. Executive report live in GHL. Report rollups, attribution bridge, QA/alerts, and executive summary API all running.

## Next Steps -- By Priority

### 1. Vapi Campaign Monitoring

- ~~Monitor Intake Poller executions to confirm steady 30/cycle churn through all 4 pools~~ — Confirmed: poller running successfully every 10 min throughout 2026-07-20 dialer outage
- ~~Monitor Outbound Dialer~~ — Dialer recovered 2026-07-20 after stuck-queue fix (contact `AX3wfQNpRwm6DG0HgUE2` deleted from GHL, `neverError: true` applied to lookup, `onError: continueRegularOutput` on call note)
- Watch for GHL rate limiting on downstream nodes
- Verify `report_referral` tool calls now get proper ack in Vapi logs (Fix #2)

### 2. Voice Hardening

- Test live calls with both Brand and Dispensary assistants after system prompt updates (discovery questions should flow one-at-a-time, no disclosure on voicemail, no "clears throat", "from Transparent eCom" not "with a transparent")
- Consider switching Jordan's voice from Nico to Emma/Layla (both already fallbacks) to eliminate remaining TTS artifacts
- Move remaining secrets out of Config nodes into n8n credentials or env-backed config
- Verify Vapi dashboard tool webhook URLs point to canonical callback

### 3. Emerald Email Campaign Ramp

Monitor first week of dispatcher runs. Verify Email_Events data quality. Increase warmup caps as sender reputation builds. Currently ~250/hr, ~1,200/day capacity with 4 senders.

### 4. Reporting Depth

- Expand contact-capture panel by channel and landing page
- Build matched funnel views by channel, campaign, and landing page

### 5. Attribution Expansion

- Build Meta Ads ingest for spend, clicks, impressions, and cost metrics

### 6. DAN Email Campaign Ramp

- Monitor dispatcher runs at 65/cycle every 30 min — verify consistent deliverability (5 fixes applied 2026-07-15)
- Track Email_Events for DAN campaign data quality (opens, clicks, bounces)
- Monitor DAN_Release_Log growth — ~1,200/day target should exhaust eligible pool in ~4 days
- Recurring DNC contacts (BRĒZ, Teal Cannabis, AYR Wellness, Nova Farms) are not written to release log but reappear each run — address stale tags in report_raw_ghl_contacts to reduce waste
- Verify sender rotation (4 senders) doesn't trigger GHL domain limits

### 7. Apollo Enrichment — MONITORING (audited + hardened 2026-07-15)

- ~~Watch polling workflow runs to confirm steady 30/cycle consumption~~ — Confirmed: batch size 50, steady 30-min runs, all successful
- ~~Verify V4 callback handler starts receiving Apollo async phone responses~~ — Confirmed: 1,058+ callbacks received by 2026-07-16, working
- ~~Confirm `queued_phone` contacts transition to `enriched` as callbacks arrive~~ — Pipeline confirmed end-to-end. Reaper now monitors both statuses.
- ~~Retune maxPerRun and schedule if Apollo rate limits appear~~ — 429 retry with 5s delay added to all 3 search sources
- ~~Ensure legacy blank contacts are not left invisible after poller write failures~~ — Fixed 2026-07-16 with hardened poller fallback + 6-contact backfill to `queued_phone`
- **ACTIVE MONITORING**: Watch Reaper Slack reports for `queued_phone` reaping counts
- **ACTIVE MONITORING**: Confirm polling `Queued At` dates flow correctly so Reaper aging works
- **ACTIVE MONITORING**: Watch for Apollo API rate limits / Apollo credit exhaustion on async phone callback requests; V4 now maps provider failures to `callback_failed`

### 8. LinkedIn Dispatcher Monitoring

- Monitor first dispatcher runs to confirm Fetch Ready Queue picks up the 14,987 `ready` contacts
- Verify dispatcher sends invites (successTag: `linkedin_connection_requested`) and updates state table correctly
- Watch for GHL rate limiting on dispatcher's per-contact API calls (tag check + LinkedIn URL extraction)
- Confirm Acceptance Checker correctly processes new connections and applies `linkedin_connected` tag

### 9. Cleanup and Adjacent Automation

- ~~Build automated LinkedIn DM suppression workflow~~ — DONE 2026-07-15. GHL tag `stop_linkedin_dms` → webhook → state table terminal. Full audit confirms all 3 send paths blocked.
- Build the separate `SimpleTexting SMS` GHL Custom Conversation Provider bridge after the user provides `conversationProviderId`; keep the existing SimpleTexting dispatcher live at low volume.
- Confirm first real SimpleTexting inbound reply posts to the existing Slack alert and suppresses future automated sends; then add GHL Conversations posting as the primary operator inbox.
- Retry and enable blocked GSC ingest workflow
- Monitor LinkedIn outbound guardrails, completion tagging, and reply-state lag after the fail-closed patch
- Clean up temporary fix scripts (scripts/fix_*.py, fix_*.js)
- ~~Delete duplicate DAN template 6a4f6fcdf74b73e4b5b9ac0b in Brands folder~~ (verified already removed 2026-07-15)
- Delete GHL export CSVs after DAN backfill confirmed healthy
