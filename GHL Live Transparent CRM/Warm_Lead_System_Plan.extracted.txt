Warm Lead Intake & Routing System Plan
1. Executive Summary
Goal: Centralize all warm lead signals into GoHighLevel (GHL), standardize tagging, and route leads through a Master Workflow for sales or nurture automation.Architecture:Channel Engagement → Apply Warm Tag → Master Workflow → Conditional Routing → Sales or Nurture
2. Backend Preparation (Foundation)
A. Install Tracking:- Install GHL tracking script on all website pages (before </body>).- Install Meta Pixel.- Install LinkedIn Insight Tag.- Enable email tracking (Apollo / Klaviyo).- Ensure SMS replies and clicks sync to GHL.B. UTM Standardization:- utm_source (instagram, facebook, linkedin, meta, email, sms)- utm_medium (organic, paid, dm)- utm_campaign- utm_contentC. Pipeline Setup:- Warm Leads Pipeline- Sales Outreach Pipeline- Sales PipelineStages:- Warm- MQL- Booked or Pending- Active Outreach- Closed Won- Closed LostD. Tag Architecture:Create all Warm – [Channel] tags:Instagram, Facebook, LinkedIn, LinkedIn DM, LinkedIn Lead Form,Meta Lead Form, Meta Traffic, Meta Remarketing,Email Outbound, Email Inbound, SMS, Website, ReferralStandard tags:- Lead Status: Warm- Stage: MQL- Engaged: Social / Website / Email / SMS
3. Active Channels (24-Hour Launch Priority)
Tier 1 – Highest Intent:- LinkedIn Lead Forms- Meta Lead Forms- Referrals- LinkedIn DM replies- Apollo email repliesTier 2 – Medium Intent:- Website engagement (2+ visits or 60+ seconds)- Meta Traffic triggers- Meta Remarketing re-visitsTier 3 – Lower Intent:- Instagram DMs- Facebook Messenger- LinkedIn post clicks
4. Channel Entry Micro-Automations
Each micro-automation must:1. Detect engagement2. Apply Warm – [Channel] tag3. Set Source field4. Set Engaged type5. Stop (Master Workflow handles routing)Examples:- LinkedIn Lead Form → Warm – LinkedIn Lead Form- Meta Lead Form → Warm – Meta Lead Form- Website intent → Warm – Website- Email reply → Warm – Email Outbound- SMS reply → Warm – SMS- Referral entry → Warm – Referral
5. Master Workflow – Warm Lead Intake & Routing
Trigger:Contact receives ANY Warm – [Channel] tag.Step 1 – Standardization:- Add Tag: Lead Status: Warm- Add Tag: Stage: MQL- Set Custom Field: Lead Stage = Warm- Move to Warm Leads PipelineStep 2 – Conditional Routing:If Referral:- Move to Sales Pipeline- Stage: Booked or Ready- Assign to Owner- Notify Sales Admin- Skip nurtureIf Lead Form (LinkedIn or Meta):- Move to Sales Outreach- Assign to Sales Admin- Start 7-Day Follow-Up SequenceIf Website / Meta Traffic / Remarketing:- Add Tag: Engaged Website Visitor- Enter 14-Day Nurture WorkflowIf Email or SMS Engagement:- Move to Sales Outreach- Start Email/SMS Follow-UpIf LinkedIn DM:- Move to Sales Outreach- Start LinkedIn Conversation Follow-Up
6. Testing & Validation
- Install tracking scripts and confirm load (external-tracking.js returns 200).- Submit test forms from each channel.- Confirm tags applied correctly.- Confirm Master Workflow triggers.- Confirm routing and assignment.- Test duplicate prevention logic.- Validate pipeline movement.
7. Recommended Domain Structure

8. Implementation Status (2026-02-12)
- Warm contact fields created and active: Lead Temperature, Warm Source, Warm Trigger Type, Warm Date, Primary Engagement Channel.
- UTM first-touch and last-touch contact fields created and active.
- LT routing metadata fields created and active.
- Duplicate UTM/LT fields created during initial setup were cleaned up; canonical single-field-per-name structure is now in place.
- Warm Date remains DATE type by decision (accepted for now).

9. Next Step Status (2026-02-13)
- GHL workflow `WL - Master Warm Intake and Routing` is configured in UI.
- Branch routing and per-branch field updates are complete.
- Next: build channel micro-automations in GHL UI (tag + source metadata only; no stage/pipeline movement).
- In parallel: deploy internal BookStack knowledgebase in Coolify and publish SOP docs for team enablement.
- BookStack docs: bookstack/README.md
- AI Agent knowledgebase is deferred to a later phase (license/usage decision pending).
- Process doc: GHL Live Transparent CRM/AI_Agent_Knowledgebase_Setup_Process.md
