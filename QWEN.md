# LiveTransparent Project

## Project Overview

LiveTransparent is a marketing automation and CRM operations platform for a B2B compliance advertising agency focused on regulated cannabis marketing. The project orchestrates lead intake, warm lead routing, cold outreach, and email sequence campaigns using a combination of:

- **n8n** - Workflow automation engine (public URL: `https://automations.livetransparent.com`)
- **GoHighLevel (GHL)** - CRM and sequence delivery platform
- **PostgreSQL** - Contact storage, release logs, and company research cache
- **BookStack** - Internal knowledgebase (prepared, not yet deployed)

The system is deployed on a VPS using **Coolify** with Docker Compose services connected over a shared internal network (`coolify-shared`).

### Core Capabilities

1. **Warm Lead Intake** - Multi-channel webhook intake (LinkedIn, Meta, Email, SMS, Referral, Website forms) with automatic tagging and routing into CRM pipelines
2. **Cold Outreach** - Apollo-enriched contact ingestion with sender-capped dispatch and timezone-aware delivery
3. **Email Sequence Campaigns** - A/B tested sequences (e.g., Cannabis Ads, Emerald campaign) with GHL workflow delivery
4. **Company Research** - AI-powered company enrichment cached in Postgres for personalized email content
5. **RB2B Integration** - Website visitor identification with GHL reconciliation and follow-up task creation

## Building and Running

### Docker Services (Coolify Deployment)

All services are deployed via Coolify using Docker Compose. Local development is not the primary workflow; changes are pushed to the repo and deployed through Coolify.

**n8n Service** (`n8n/docker-compose.yml`):
```bash
# Deployed via Coolify with:
# - Image: n8nio/n8n:2.9.4
# - Public host: automations.livetransparent.com
# - Internal network: coolify-shared
# - Postgres backend
```

**PostgreSQL Service** (`postgres/docker-compose.yml`):
```bash
# Deployed via Coolify with:
# - Image: postgres:17.7
# - Internal network: coolify-shared
# - Persistent volume: postgres_data
```

**BookStack Service** (`bookstack/docker-compose.yml`):
```bash
# Staged for deployment (not yet live)
# - Internal knowledgebase restricted to team access
# - MariaDB backend
# - Traefik routing via Coolify
```

### Operational Scripts

**PowerShell - Cold Outreach Prep**:
```powershell
# Process Cold-outreach contacts.xlsx into GHL/Postgres import CSVs
.\cold-outreach-prep\prepare_cold_outreach.ps1
```

**Python - Emerald Cache Reset**:
```powershell
# Create temporary reset workflow for bad cache rows
python scripts/rerun_bad_emerald_sso_companies.py create [company_keys...]

# Delete temporary workflow after execution
python scripts/rerun_bad_emerald_sso_companies.py delete <workflow_id>
```

### n8n Workflow Management

**Direct REST API** (verified working from Windows):
```bash
# Get workflow
curl -H "X-N8N-API-KEY: <key>" "https://automations.livetransparent.com/api/v1/workflows/<id>"

# Update workflow (minimal payload)
curl -X PUT -H "X-N8N-API-KEY: <key>" -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"name":"...","nodes":[...],"connections":{...},"settings":{}}' \
  "https://automations.livetransparent.com/api/v1/workflows/<id>"
```

**MCP Tools** (via Codex):
- Use `n8n-lt` MCP for workflow discovery, activation checks, and execution
- Use `ghl_official` MCP for GHL data reads
- Use `ghl_workflows` MCP with caution (some endpoints may fail with scope errors)

## Key Configuration Files

### Environment Variables

- **Root `.env`** - Shared credentials (not tracked in git)
- **`n8n/.env`** - n8n-specific secrets (encryption key, DB password)
- **`bookstack/.env.example`** - BookStack environment template

### Service References

- **`n8n/nodes/apollo/REFERENCE.md`** - Apollo API endpoint mapping
- **`n8n/nodes/ghl/REFERENCE.md`** - GHL API endpoint mapping
- **`n8n/nodes/twilio/REFERENCE.md`** - Twilio API endpoint mapping

## Development Conventions

### Workflow Update Pattern

1. **Verify first** - Use `n8n-lt` MCP to read current workflow state
2. **Build locally** - Construct full `nodes` and `connections` arrays locally
3. **Direct REST for large changes** - Use `PUT /workflows/{id}` with minimal payload (`name`, `nodes`, `connections`, `settings`)
4. **Verify after** - Re-read workflow and confirm `active`, `defaultDryRun`, and changed parameters

### GHL Integration Rules

- **Field naming** - Use exact GHL custom field names (e.g., `marketing_sender_email`, `Apollo Phone Enrichment Status`)
- **Tag hygiene** - Tags are appended non-destructively; removal requires explicit action
- **Pipeline stages** - Reference by ID, not name (see `AGENTS.md` for locked pipeline map)
- **Direct API fallback** - If MCP fails with scope errors, test endpoint directly against `https://services.leadconnectorhq.com`
- **LinkedIn supply path** - For the LinkedIn connection-request queue, use the working GHL `contacts/` list endpoint and filter locally by LinkedIn URL custom fields and tags. Treat `contacts/search` failures against private-integration tokens as a live blocker, not a harmless empty result.

### Data Processing

- **CSV imports** - Dedupe by email first, then name/company, then phone
- **Snake case conversion** - Postgres columns use snake_case (handled by `prepare_cold_outreach.ps1`)
- **Timezone handling** - Contact-local dispatch with explicit timezone resolution order
- **Dry-run discipline** - Keep `defaultDryRun=true` for staged workflows until ready for production

### Marketing Copy Alignment

Before drafting or revising contact-facing copy, reference:
- **Brand voice** - `Marketing Docs/Transparent_eCom_Brand_Voice_And_Foundation.docx`
- **ICP** - `Marketing Docs/Transparent_eCom_Core_Customer_ICP.docx`
- **Segments** - `Marketing Docs/Transparent_eCom_Strategic_Priority_Segments.docx`

## Active Workflows (Snapshot)

See `AGENTS.md` for the authoritative, up-to-date workflow inventory. Key production workflows include:

| Workflow | ID | Status |
|----------|-----|--------|
| Website Lead Intake (Hero) | `RTV5jUiTt05lad07` | Active |
| Website Lead Intake (Footer) | `RSfLF7LU0rDC4jAI` | Active |
| GHL Apollo Phone Enrichment - Callback Handler V4 | `U7c6byTLXAMgcS75` | Active |
| LT - Cold Outreach Sender Release Dispatcher | `NTpQnMrpjzusPXHX` | Active |
| LT - Emerald Campaign Sender Release Dispatcher | `8UXlpoMJnQ229AuG` | Active |
| rb2b leads | `3kjsIUeoEQFx26cC` | Active |
| WL - Webhook to Slack Channel Update | `lQTW0QPwBcf3o7j8` | Active |

## GHL Pipelines (Locked Map)

### Warm Pipeline
`New` → `Qualified (MQL)` → `Routed to Outreach` → `Nurture Active` → `Disqualified`

### Sales Outreach Pipeline
`New` → `Attempting Contact` → `Engaged` → `Meeting Requested` → `Booked` → `Unresponsive`

### Sales Pipeline
`Discovery Scheduled` → `Discovery Completed` → `Proposal Sent` → `Negotiation` → `Closed Won` → `Closed Lost`

## Important Operational Notes

1. **Status freshness** - Treat all "Current" / "Active" status items in `AGENTS.md` as "last known state" and re-verify in-system before acting
2. **TLS/schannel on Windows** - Direct `curl.exe` to HTTPS endpoints may fail; use Python `requests` or Node `fetch` for API verification
3. **MCP mutation limits** - If `n8n-lt` mutation helpers fail or ignore `active`, switch to direct REST API
4. **Emerald campaign** - Use Postgres table `Emerald_Campaign_Contacts` as dispatch source, not live GHL smart lists
5. **Sender caps** - Week 1: 300/day, Week 2: 400/day, Week 3+: 500/day (total outbound per sender, including in-flight sequence sends)
